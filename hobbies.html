			<h2><span>| </span>Basketball</h2>

			<p>Basketball has been my favorite sport since I was first introduced to it in Grade 3. I remember being invited to play during reccess, and the moment I stepped onto the court and started playing, it felt amazing. Ever since then, I've been playing and watching basketball on a regular basis. I'm also a big NBA fanatic, I like to watch the NBA daily whenever I have the time. Watching proffessional basketball players play at an elite level I find entertaining to watch as I'm an extremely competitive person myself. As for my favorite NBA team, that would be the Miami Heat! They were the first NBA team I ended up watching when I was younger, and I've been loyal to them ever since despite having completely different players every couple of years. I could go on and on talking about basketball, but I'll end it here before I end up writing an essay on the sport I'm very passionate about.</p>

			<h2><span>| </span>Chess</h2>

			<p>During quarantine last year, I picked up a new hobby to pass by time: Chess. However, I did not expect the board game to be as addiciting as it was.  The strategic and competitive nature of chess is very appealing to me. Ever since I started playing, I've spent hours studying chess openings such as the Caro Kann, Vienna, Slav Defense and more openings. I've been quite immersed and I admit, somewhat addicted to the game. I play multiple Chess games online every week. Last year, I had started out with an 800 rating in rapid chess (30 minute time intervals). As of today, I am now rated 1700 in rapid chess, a significant improvement from last year. However, recently I've hit a road block and can't seem to ascend any higher. This just means I have to spend more hours studying theory and practicing my chess tactics. Although chess may sound boring and complicated, it's actually an amazing game and I would recommend the game to anybody.</p>
