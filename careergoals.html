		<h2><span>| </span>Learn New Skills</h2>

		<p>For the first step in my career, I would like to to obtain and learn valuable skills I will be able to utilize in a workplace environment in the future. As a student right now, I should prioritize developing and acquiring new skills which can help me become more familiar with my field of study, as well as determining my strengths and weaknesses. By identifying my strengths and weaknesses through skill building, I will be able to identify what I need to work on in the long-term. Also, I should be able to build an early solid foundation in my career which would only benefit me in the future. In addition, building new skills can help me enjoy my work more which would in turn, improve my performance. I will also be able to build solid work habits which I will be able to use as a student and in the workplace in the future to help advance my career.</p>

		<h2><span>| </span>Expand My Proffessional Network</h2>

		<p>Networking is an extremely important skill to have in order to get a chance to land interview at big software companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and more. By expanding my proffessional network, I'll be able to increase my chances of landing an interview at certain companies, and give myself more opportunities to succeed. Building a strong network should be a long-term goal for anyone as you'll be able to develop healthier relationships with others in a similar field of study and help you advance further in your career. In addition, with networking, I'll be able to build confidence as I continue to step outside of my comfort zone. I'll also be able to learn new perspectives from other people which can help me grow as an individual.</p>
